The worst case time complexity of the rehash function is O(n^2) because the amount of time that it takes relies on the amount of elements squared. First, the hash table has to be copied over into a new hash table. Then the old hash table has to be resized, and then cleared. The O(n^2) part comes in when the hash table has to be looped through, and then the insert function that is called also loops through the hash table, meaning that it is a loop within a loop. Therefore, the worst case time complexity is O(n^2). The worst case time complexity for removeUser from PassServer is O(n) because all the function has to do is loop through the hash table once and see if the user exists. Afterwards, the hash table gets looped through again to then delete the user. Therefore the worst case time complexity is O(n), because it is just a loop, not a loop within a loop.
