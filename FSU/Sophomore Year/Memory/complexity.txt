The time complexity of the reverse function is O(n) because the function only has to loop through the list once, and then push front each node into a new list when the iterator reaches it. Then all it has to do is set the temp list to the current list so that the current list has the reversed contents. The release_mem function is still O(n) because the fucntion only has to iterate through the list and check if the indexes are equal to the passed in one. If not, the block is inserted, which doenst add anything on to the O(n) since it is not calling any other function with loops.
