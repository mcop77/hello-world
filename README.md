# hello-world
This repository is the first of many

What's up, this is Marshall. I'm excited to be taking this class because I feel like I am going to be learning a lot of useful information that will be important in my future
career. My current interest is in Cyber Security, not sure what specifically yet, but the whole field is super interesting so I would be happy in any postion. I am trying to learn 
ethical hacking techniques that I can apply to Capture The Flag type sites like HackTheBox.eu, and also just get comfortable with Kali Linux and the terminal, as well as the tools
that come with it.
