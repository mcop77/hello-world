# Personal Repo

What's up, this is Marshall. I am currently a Junior at Florida State University. My current interest is in Cyber Security, not sure what specifically yet, but the whole field is super interesting so I would be happy in any postion. I am trying to learn 
ethical hacking techniques that I can apply to Capture The Flag type sites like HackTheBox.eu, and also just get comfortable with Kali Linux and the terminal, as well as the tools
that come with it.
